### The program needs 2 inputs.

1- The quantity of numbers that are going to be computed
2- The number in int.

The **output** is the print of all the internal arrays in the program and the plotting of the values in a graph, following the Collatz's conjecture.

*(try out plotting numbers 27 and 195)*
